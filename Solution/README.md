# Real-Time Monitoring of Door Status in Public Transit Systems

### Introduction

This is the final project competition of the Computer Vision Course (Spring 2024, National Taiwan University) sponsored by Vivotek.

### Getting Started

This folder contains the implementation of training a fine-tuned Swin Transformer V2 for image classification and the pre-trained models and weights.

#### Install

- Create a conda virtual environment and activate it:

```bash
conda create -n swin python=3.10 -y
conda activate swin
```

- Install requirements:

```bash
pip install -r requirements
```

#### Data preparation

To predict the results of videos, place the target videos into the `Tests` folder at the same directory.

### Generate prediction

```bash
python generate_output.py
```

### Train our fine-tuned model

:warning: Once a model is trained, it will replace the pre-trained model.

```bash
python train.py && python generate_output.py
```
