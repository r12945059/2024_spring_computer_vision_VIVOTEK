*Sample Video Files for Algorithm Development

    01.mp4
    02.mp4
    03.mp4
    These video files are intended for use in developing and testing your door state monitoring algorithm.

*Sample Python Scripts

    total_frames.py: Retrieves the total number of frames in a video file.
    algorithm_template.py: Provides a template for creating a JSON file that can be used for evaluation.
    evaluate.py: Implements the scoring method to assess the accuracy of the door state monitoring algorithm. Run this script to evaluate your algorithm based on the sample video files.

*Sample JSON Files

    ground_truth_annotations.json: Contains the ground truth data for the sample video files. Essential for algorithm evaluation.
    algorithm_output.json: An example of a JSON file generated by algorithm_template.py, used for evaluation purposes.
